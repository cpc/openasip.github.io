      <h2>The TTA Principle</h2>
      <p>Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA) is a processor design philosophy 
        where the processors internal datapaths are exposed in the instruction set. 
        All operation parameter reads and result writes are explicitly stated in the instruction set. </p>

      <p>TTA processor datapath consists of execution units, register files and buses that connect them. 
        The processor is programmed by controlling directly the buses, and operations are executed as 
        side-effect of these moves, by moving data to a specific trigger port of an function unit.</p>

      <p>One operation typically consist of multiple moves, one for each operand and one for each 
        result value. The instruction word for a TTA processor typically consists of a move slot 
        for every datapath bus, so that every instruction word can contain multiple moves, one 
        for each bus. Every instruction word can contain moves from multiple operations, so the 
        instruction set states explicit instruction level parallelism, like VLIW processors. 
        On TTA processors, however, all moves needed to perform an operation typically span 
        multiple instruction words.</p>

      <h2>TTA Compared to VLIW</h2>

      <p>Compared to VLIW, TTA exposes more of the internal architecture in the instruction set. 
        In VLIW register file bypassing is either not done, or done implicitly, but on TTA 
        bypassing is done explicitly by programming a move directly from one function unit to another.</p>

      <p>Because all the datapath buses inside the processor are visible on the instruction set, 
        they can be optimized to contain only the necessary connections, allowing such bypasses that 
        give most performance benefits but not allowing some rarely used non-performance-critical 
        bypass opportunities. Having less connections on datapath buses allows the interconnection 
        network to consume smaller area, and the processor to become  faster and more energy-efficient.</p>

      <p>As moves of one operation can span multiple instruction words, all of the processor state cannot 
        be represented by the registers alone, and also includes state inside execution units. This makes 
        supporting interrupts difficult and costly to implement, and most TTA processors do not have 
        interrupt support. For the same reason also hardware-based pre-emptive multi-threading cannot be 
        easily implemented on a TTA processor. This limits the applicability of TTA to applications that 
        need not be interrupted, but can run to completion, which is often the case with accelerators and 
        application specific processors.  </p>

      <h2>TTAs as Application-Specific Processors</h2>

      <p>TTA processors can be easily customized, by just adding new function units and register files, 
        and connecting them to existing buses, and by adding new transport buses to improve parallel data 
        transport capabilities. Thus, TTA is a good processor template for the design of Application 
        Specific Processors (ASP) where custom hardware operations are often important for performance. 
        The drawbacks of TTAs often are not issues with ASPs where there is often no need to run 
        multitasking operating systems or third party code.</p>
