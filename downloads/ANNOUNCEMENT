OpenASIP v2.0 Released
-----------------------

OpenASIP, also known as TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE), is an open
source application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) toolset for
design and programming of customized co-processors (compiler-programmable
accelerators). It is based on the static energy efficient Transport Triggered
Architecture (TTA) processor template.

The toolset provides a complete retargetable LLVM-based compiler supported
co-design flow from high-level language programs down to FPGA/ASIC
synthesizable processor RTL (VHDL and Verilog generation supported) and
instruction-parallel program binaries.

The size and quantity of register files, function units, supported operations,
and the interconnection network can be freely customized to create new
co-processors ranging from small single-application specific cores with
special operations to more general multi-issue domain-specific processors.

Notable Changes
===============
- Added support for LLVM 15.
- Experimental RISC-V support:
  - Generate RISC-V ASIPs with custom instruction set extensions
    (see the RISC-V Tutorial in manual for usage).
  - New Operation Triggered Architecture (OTA) formats that map to the formats
    of the RISC-V ISA.
  - New operations added to OSAL for RISC-V
  - oacc-riscv compiler driver that is able to adapt to RISC-V
    custom instructions.
- Toolset name change:
  - To reflect the wider ISA support than TTAs, the "TCE" name is now changed
    to "OA" (OpenASIP) in most of the places and the old name phased out.
  - Tools such as the compiler "tcecc" have been deprecated and replaced with
    "oacc". To keep backwards compability, the old tools still work.
- FUGen:
  - Automated function unit RTL implementation generation feature: Hardware
    is generated automatically if an operation has a DAG description that
    can be resolved to an "HDL snippet".
- Zero-register support:
  - Since RISC-V needed it, a new register file attribute "zero-register" was
    added to ADF. This indicates that the first index of the register file is
    hardcoded to a zero value and thus can be utilized as the zero immediate
    value.
- DAG syntax changes:
  - New "Var" and "OP" keywords that can be used alongside "SimValue"
    and "EXEC_OPERATION".
- AlmaIFV2:
  - Hardware generation support for AlmaIFV2 was added.
  - Read more on the following publication:

    Pekka J채채skel채inen:"Unified OpenCL Integration Methodology for FPGA Designs",
    in NorCAS 2021: IEEE Nordic Circuits and Systems Conference
- RTL generation code has been unified.
- oacc --data-start can be used to redefine the global data
  starting address in the default address space.
- Program Image Generation supports Bin2n-format, which is a binary format
  where each word has been zero-padded to the next power-of-two. Used for
  AlmaIF instruction memory region.
- The license has been changed to LGPL v2.1.

Notable bugfixes
----------------------------
- GUIs: Patches to GTK assertion errors on (mostly) non-Ubuntu systems.
  Fixes Github issue #140. Thanks to Sarah Clark of Google.
